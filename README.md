# Cryptography_App
This application is a cryptography tool that supports three different methods: Caesar Cipher, Affine Cipher, and Vigenere Cipher. The application is written in Python and uses the tkinter and customtkinter libraries to create the graphical user interface (GUI).

Features
1. Caesar Cipher
  > Encrypts text by shifting characters.
  > User inputs the text and the key.

2. Affine Cipher
  > Encrypts and decrypts text using the parameters a and b.
  > User inputs the text and the parameters.

3. Vigenere Cipher
 > Encrypts and decrypts text using a key.
 > User inputs the text and the key.

* Usage Instructions
  > Select the encryption method from the main page.
  > Enter the text and the necessary details (key or parameters).
  > Click the button to encrypt or decrypt.
  > View the result on the screen.
  > 
* Requirements
  > Python 3.x
  > tkinter and customtkinter libraries
